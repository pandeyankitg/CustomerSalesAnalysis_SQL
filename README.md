# SQL_Projects

Hello! Welcome to my SQL portfolio. This code repository contains examples of SQL codes I've written. Feel free to take a look around and e-mail me if you have any questions üëãüèæ
You can also see the PowerBI Dashboard here: https://public.tableau.com/authoring/SalesDashboardbyAnkitPandey/Dashboard1#1



1. Data Cleaning and Exploration:
- SQL (Structured Query Language) for data grouping and filtering.
- Used descriptive statistics- mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range.
2. RFM Analysis and Customer Segmentation:
- Used RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.
3. Tableau Dashboard for Visual Summary:
- Drag-and-drop interface to create - bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
- Storytelling features- annotations, captions, and narrations
4. Time Series Analysis and Forecasting:
- Used SQL commands- DATE, YEAR, MONTH, and WEEK, to extract and manipulate the time-related data.
- Time series forecasting models- ARIMA, SARIMA, and Exponential Smoothing.
- Performance metrics- Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
5. Predictive Modeling and Machine Learning:
- Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
- Feature engineering- one-hot encoding, feature scaling, and feature selection.
- Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.
- Model interpretation techniques- feature importance plots and SHAP values.
- Used Python libraries- sci-kit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.

Conclusions-
We have identified and created key business metrics to help identify how the business is performing.
We have successfully created a new and repeat customer flag.
We calculated the customer retention rate.
We calculated the daily averages to see how the business is performing on a daily basis.
